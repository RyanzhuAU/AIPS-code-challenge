How to install:

Download or clone from this repository

Use maven to build this application. Go to the application folder and type mvn clean install.

Start the application by "java -jar target/seek_test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar test_data.txt". 
(As in the requirement, it didn't specify the file type. So I just use the text file for now. If the file type is csv or xml, the file reader needs to be updated.)
